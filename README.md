# Health & Lifestyle Metrics: Obesity Analysis Dashboard

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing health and lifestyle factors that influence obesity levels. It leverages a publicly available dataset and uses Excel to build an **interactive dashboard** that visually represents key trends and correlations, supporting data-driven decisions in health awareness and education.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Easily filter data based on gender and age groups.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Pie Chart: Gender distribution
  - Clustered Bar Chart: Gender vs Obesity Level
  - Stacked Column Chart: Fast Food Consumption vs Obesity
  - 100% Stacked Column: Age Group vs Obesity Level
  - KPI Cards: % of Fast Food Consumers, Inactive Users, Male/Female
  - Correlation Heatmap: Relationships between numerical attributes
  - Bar Chart: Water Intake (CH2O) and BMI
  - Slicer-enabled Dashboard: Dynamic filtering and exploration
